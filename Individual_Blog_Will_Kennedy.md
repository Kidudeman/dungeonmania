## Week 5

- (Nothing)

## Week 6

- (Nothing)

## Week 7

- Finished half of task 1. Part A was simply creating movement strategies, Part E was very broad and I had to remove numerous Law Of Demeter violations which were extensive.

## Week 8

- Finished most of the remaining Law of Demeter violations and included further refactoring. Largely completed the Logical Entities task which was simply required a simply DFS implementation to check for entity activation. It could (likely) be done with a better time complexity using a activation propagation method whereby logical entities have an 'activated' property and changes to that activation property would propagate to other 'dependent' logical entities which are calculated on start up - narrowing the search field and encoding (statefully) the activation -> (like this)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-reactivity-build-signals-from-scratch/]

## Week 9

Finished off all logical entities and completing the microevolution task. Finalizing test writing.
