## Week 5

- (Nothing)

## Week 6

- (Nothing)

## Week 7

- Finished task 1. Found the observer pattern and refactored the way items are added so there is now an add function for each item so adding is done within the entity

## Week 8

- Changed task 1 solution, realised that was bad code design as the same function was in every item and replaced with a default method within the inventory item method that applies to all of them
- Completed half of task 2 - implemented sunstones correctly and have created classes and basic logic for the sceptre and midnight_armour and they are able to be built but do not have there buffs yet
- Need to properly understand how battling and the ticks work before doing buffs
- Finished most of the remaining Law of Demeter violations and included further refactoring. Largely completed the Logical Entities task

## Week 9

- Finished off the buff implementation for both midnight_armour and sceptre
- Added testing
